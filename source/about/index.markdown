# About / Contact
I'm Dave Liggat, an independent software engineer with a Ruby on Rails/Analytics/Infrastructure/AWS (and, once in a while ASP.NET).  Opinions are my own.

## Contact

If you need to reach me, Twitter is a good starting point. If you @-mention me with a request, I can follow back, and then you can send me a [private] DM.

#### Twitter
* [@liggs](https://twitter.com/liggs): My canonical personal account online. Mostly used for inane observations and retweets.
* [@liggat_org](https://twitter.com/liggat_org): An [IFFTT](http://ifftt.com)-generated feed of this site's items.

#### GitHub
I spend most of my workday with GitHub always close to hand. I'm [dliggat](https://github.com/dliggat) there. I've got various projects there in the public domain, including my [dotfiles](https://github.com/dliggat/dotfiles) and my [boxen repository]([dotfiles](https://github.com/dliggat/boxen). Feel free to use/modify any of that stuff, and let me know if you need any help.

#### Business - Factorial Systems Inc
For business inquiries or anything otherwise pertinent, feel free to contact me through my [company site](http://factorialsystems.ca/contact/).

#### Disqus
I haven't had an account long enough to know if it's significant, but I'm [dliggat](http://disqus.com/dliggat/) on Disqus.

#### LinkedIn
Mostly for completeness, my profile is [daveliggat](http://ca.linkedin.com/in/daveliggat).
